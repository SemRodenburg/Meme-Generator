### Project Description

Welcome Co-Developers, this is a project of mine that I did. This application is build so that you can create your own memes in just two simple steps. 
<br>

1. First you can choose a random meme image from the API call by simply clicking the **_new image_** button.
2. Then you can add your own Top & Bottom text by filling in the inputs with your own text.
   
This project is build with a few different languages like HTML5, CSS3, and React17. The syntax of ReactJS looks and feels a lot like Vanilla Javascript because it is a Javascript Framework. But where Vanilla Javascript is mainly used for the back-end of an application, whereas ReactJS is a Javascript front-end library.
<br>

> **_NOTE:_** React17 is not the latest version of React, (that is React18). I am not using the latest version of React because there has been some slight changes in the syntax.
<br> The reason I am still using React17 is beacause you can still use the `React.render()` method. In React18 it works a little bit different but that is not neccasary to explain here. But if you're interested, feel free to check [HERE](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide#updates-to-client-rendering-apis) so you can still use it yourself. 
<br>

Some challenges I came across during the time I was working on this project where issues like: 
<br>

> _The page wasn't rendering because of a missing_ `type="module"` _attribute in the script tag of the index.HTML_.

Or one other issue i came across was:
<br>

> _That the `onClick={}` function wasn't working because my submit button wasn't submitting because of a missing_ `type="button"`.
