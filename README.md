### Project Description

Welcome Co-Developers, this is a project of mine that I did. This application is build so that you can create your own memes in just two simple steps. 
<br>

1. First you can choose a random meme image from the API call by simply clicking the **_new image_** button.
2. Then you can add your own Top & Bottom text by filling in the **_inputs_** with your own text.

This project is build with a few different languages like HTML5, CSS3, and React17. The syntax of ReactJS looks and feels a lot like Vanilla Javascript because it is a Javascript Framework. But where Vanilla Javascript is mainly used for the back-end of an application, whereas ReactJS is a Javascript front-end library.
<br>

> **_NOTE:_** React17 is not the latest version of React, (that is React18). I am not using the latest version of React because there has been some slight changes in the syntax.
<br> The reason I am still using React17 is beacause you can still use the `React.render()` method. In React18 it works a little bit different but that is not neccasary to explain here. But if you're interested, feel free to check [HERE](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide#updates-to-client-rendering-apis) so you can still use it yourself. 
<br>

Some challenges I came across during the time I was working on this project where issues like: 
<br>

> _The page wasn't rendering because of a missing_ `type="module"` _attribute in the script tag of the index.HTML_.

Or one other issue i came across was:
<br>

> _That the `onClick={}` function wasn't working because my submit button wasn't submitting because of a missing_ `type="button"`.

## How to install & run this project

The first thing you will need to do is go to your webbrowser and download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
<br>
NodeJS is necesarry to download so we can make use of `npm commands`.

If you want to run this project on your own desktop locally there are a few steps you need to do.
<br>

1. You will have to scroll to the top of this page.
2. There you will find a **_blue button_** with the word **_CODE_** in it that you will need to click.
3. After you clicked the blue button you should find a button that says **_Download Zip_**. Click on it. 
<br>

* Once you have unzipped the project folder you will have to open that project in you preffered code editor.
<br> Personally I use 
[PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/promo/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=EMEA_en_NL_PhpStorm_Branded&term=phpstorm&content=604081945420&gclid=CjwKCAiA8YyuBhBSEiwA5R3-E-4VA5g58NxfzlqRCCgYr4iBeScSx_ZeW80mlVQkwt731UmILBLvABoCecAQAvD_BwE), 
so if you want to check that out for yourself you can click the link.

* When you have opened the project folder inside of your code editor, you need to navigate to your code editor's **_terminal_**.
  
* Once you have opened the terminal, you will have to type: `cd my-meme`.
  <br>
  This will navigate you to the right folder that **_Vite_** made when it created this project.

* When you can see in the terminals path that you are in the right folder, you can type: `npm run dev`.
  <br>
  This will run the project and create a https://localhost:xxxx of your existing application.

* Anddd Voil√†, you have installed and run a Vite + React project on your local desktop.
